# Contact_map_Visualiztion


Author: Amirhossein Saali


## Project Overview

This project is aimed to conduct an statistical post processing on the output data resulted from [Protein Contact Map](https://github.com/Amirsaali/Protein_Contact_Map_Lammps_trajectory_file) project.

The result of the [Protein Contact Map](https://github.com/Amirsaali/Protein_Contact_Map_Lammps_trajectory_file) project is saved on [plotting_material.csv](https://github.com/Amirsaali/Contact_map_Visualiztion/blob/main/plotting_material.csv). This file contains all of the contacts over the course of the simulation.

Various graphs are generated by this program. following graphs are sample graphs generated by this program.

- ### Single Snapshots:




This piece of code and [Protein Contact Map](https://github.com/Amirsaali/Protein_Contact_Map_Lammps_trajectory_file) project are useful for studying the proteins contacts over the course of the simulation using lammps.
