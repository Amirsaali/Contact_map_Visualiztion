# Contact_map_Visualiztion


Author: Amirhossein Saali


## Project Overview

This project is aimed to conduct an statistical post processing on the output data resulted from [Protein Contact Map](https://github.com/Amirsaali/Protein_Contact_Map_Lammps_trajectory_file) project.

The result of the [Protein Contact Map](https://github.com/Amirsaali/Protein_Contact_Map_Lammps_trajectory_file) project is saved on [plotting_material.csv](https://github.com/Amirsaali/Contact_map_Visualiztion/blob/main/plotting_material.csv). This file contains all of the contacts over the course of the simulation.

Various graphs are generated by this program. following graphs are sample graphs generated by this program.

- #### Single Snapshots: 

 This graph is the sample of four individual snapshots generated by this graph.

- #### All models: 


 This graph is the plotting all contacts available in all snapshots in one graph.

- #### Probability Plot: 


This graph is showing the probability of every specific contact over the course of the simulation.

This piece of code and [Protein Contact Map](https://github.com/Amirsaali/Protein_Contact_Map_Lammps_trajectory_file) project are useful for studying proteins contacts over the course of the simulation using lammps.
